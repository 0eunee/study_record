## [문제] 키위 주스
> 탑코더 알고리즘 트레이닝 65p

Taro has prepared delicious kiwi fruit juice. He poured it into N bottles numbered from 0 to N-1. The capacity of the i-th bottle is *capacities[i]* liters, and he poured *bottles[i]* liters of kiwi juice into this bottle.
Now he wants to redistribute juice in the bottles. In order to do this, he will perform M operations numbered from 0 to M-1 in the order in which he will perform them. For the i-th operation, he will pour kiwi juice from bottle *fromId[i]* to bottle *toId[i]*. He will stop pouring when bottle *fromId[i]* becomes empty or bottle *toId[i]* becomes full, whichever happens earlier.
Return an int[] that contains exactly N elements and whose i-th element is the amount of kiwi juice in the i-th bottle after all pouring operations are finished.

## 내 풀이
```java
public class KiwiJuiceEasy {

	public static int[] thePouring(int[] capacities, int[] bottles, int[] fromId, int[] toId) {

		for (int i = 0; i < fromId.length; i++) {
			int toCapacities = capacities[toId[i]];
			int toBottles = bottles[toId[i]];
			int fromBottles = bottles[fromId[i]];
			int space = toCapacities - toBottles;

			if (space >= fromBottles) {
				toBottles += fromBottles;
				fromBottles = 0;
			} else {
				toBottles += space;
				fromBottles -= space;
			}
		}

		return bottles;

	}

}
